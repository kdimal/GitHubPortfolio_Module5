To better perform an apples-to-apples comparison of coupon takers, a metric called "Take Rate" was created.  This is defined as the percentage of respondents who picked the coupon. Numerator is defined as respondents Y=1, denominator is count of coupon (Y=0 or 1)

From a demographic standpoint, the top coupon takers are as follows:

88.24% of 50+ year old, divorced males
84.09% of 31 year old unmarried partner males
73% of 41 year old single males

Except for the 26 year old age group, there are more coupon takers in males at an average of 59.08%.  The rate is lower by 4.35 percentage points for females.

There is a higher propensity of taking the coupon for respondents who are not going to an urgent place (destination) when they are alone.

There is also a significant take rate at when the person is not going to an urgent place at the hours between 10am and 6pm (around 60% to 66%)

Income also plays a part, where the top 2 takers are respondents with income of 50k to 62.5k (59.55%), 25k-37.5k (59.31%) and <12.5k (59.31%).  Less than half of 75k to 87.5k earners (48.31%) take the coupon.


There is a significant take rate a day before coupon expiration 62.56% vs 49.6% for 2 hours. This is more prevalent if the respondent has no urgent place to go.

Based on weather and temperature, there are is a higher take rate when it's Sunny (59.48%).  Specifically cold (30 degrees) and warm (80 degrees) with 62.46% and 60.03% respectively.  There is a less than 50% chance for snowy and rainy weather.

Recommendations for higher take rate:

1.  Set coupon expiration to at least a day.
2.  Schedule marketing efforts for these coupons when there is a predicted chance of sunny weather.
3.  Market the coupons during "off-peak" hours when the person is not known to be going to home nor work.  This works best in the top 3 time slots of 6pm, 2pm and 10am. 
4.  Across gender, there is approximately a 5-point gap for males vs females.  Marketing allocation may need to reflect this proportion.
5.  Since all the age groups show greater than 50% take rates, marketing allocation may need to reflect the same proportion.
